We understand that you, as an immigrant healthcare worker, have made a valued and courageous choice. We know you decided to get vaccinated for COVID-19 not just for your own protection, but also for the security and safety of your elderly patients.

Recognized health professionals like those you trust have commended such actions because the latest data substantiates that COVID-19 vaccines substantially decrease the risk of severe illness and hospitalization from the virus. They especially safeguard the health of vulnerable individuals like senior citizens and those with underlying health conditions.

Rest assured, while vaccine research moved quickly, no shortcuts were taken. The mRNA technology, which might have caused some concern due to circulating rumors, has been under study for decades. Its effectiveness counters the misinformation, and health professionals have emphasized its safety in various languages, including yours.

We understand your faith and commitment to preserving life and serving others. The vaccine aids by offering you the opportunity to help protect your patients from severe COVID-19 symptoms.

Remember, you aren't alone, but rather, part of a broader healthcare community. You've taken the right step, and with each passing day, we see the fruits of these collective efforts. The unfailing spirit of healthcare workers like you, your resilience, and choice to believe in experience, have served as a beacon of hope in challenging times and continue to do so.

Yours Sincerely,
The Scientific Community."
