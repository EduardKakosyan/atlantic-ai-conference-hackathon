The latest data from health authorities indicates that vaccinated individuals are significantly less likely to experience severe symptoms or require hospitalization compared to unvaccinated individuals. This protection is particularly important for older adults and those with underlying health conditions.

As a student, you probably have family, friends, and social media feeds all giving you different perspectives on vaccines. Sounds like you’re caught up in the middle, so let’s clarify a few things.

Firstly, as someone with some trust in scientific bodies, you'll appreciate hearing that several studies show that vaccines are mighty weapons against severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization. This is particularly relevant for older people and folks with underlying health conditions.

Let's talk about some of those concerns you have. Fertility issues due to the vaccine? Nope, not a thing. A study posted on Reddit’s r/science (subscribed to 24.6 million people worldwide, by the way) debunked this myth. No evidence has been found that the vaccine interferes with fertility in men or women.

Seeing contradictory news? Remember, not all sources are credible. Be sure to check out World Health Organisation’s (WHO) website for accurate information. In fact, trusty Reddit users are constantly posting and upvoting reliable sources where you can check out the original data for yourself.

Concerns about side effects? Totally understandable. The key thing to remember is side effects show the vaccine is working, kind of like muscle soreness after a good workout. And according to the scientific community, they're temporary and far less scary than getting hospitalised due to COVID-19.

Lastly, you know those influencers on TikTok inspiring us to be our best selves? Many have talked about their positive experiences getting vaccinated. Instagram Reel's #GetVaccinated trend also showcases real people sharing their vaccination stories - something we all can relate to.

So, we’ve debunked a few myths and hopefully brought you some clarity. Your health is your own, Marcus, and seeking out good information is a great way to protect it. The ball is in your court. Be safe."
