The data suggests more durable immunity for vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated populations. Researchers at Harvard Medical School have published a study on antibody longevity related to COVID-19 vaccines. The study confirms previous results, adding to our understanding of vaccine efficacy. Researchers at University of Oxford have published a study on demographic response differences related to COVID-19 vaccines. The study challenges conventional wisdom, adding to our understanding of vaccine efficacy.",
