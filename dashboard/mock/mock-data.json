Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccines show declining effectiveness against the Delta variant. Research from Oxford University indicates that immunity may wane over time for high-risk individuals, particularly pregnant women. A new report by immunologists explores the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccines. Their findings demonstrate minimal side effects, which could impact vaccine mandates moving forward. Researchers at University of Washington have published a study on breakthrough infections related to COVID-19 vaccines. The study supports current recommendations, adding to our understanding of immune response mechanisms.",
