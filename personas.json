        "article": "COVID-19 vaccines help the body develop immunity without causing illness. They work by teaching the immune system to recognize and fight the virus. Different types of vaccines use various methods to achieve this. mRNA vaccines instruct cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. Protein subunit vaccines use harmless pieces of the virus to stimulate immunity. Vaccines do not contain live virus and cannot cause COVID-19. They do not interact with or alter DNA. The immune response involves the production of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. It typically takes a few weeks to build immunity after vaccination. Some individuals may experience mild side effects like fever. These symptoms are normal signs of the body building protection. Vaccination reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization. It contributes to community immunity and pandemic control. The CDC provides detailed information on vaccine mechanisms. Understanding how vaccines work can alleviate public concerns. The agency emphasizes the safety and efficacy of approved vaccines. Ongoing research continues to monitor vaccine performance. The CDC encourages vaccination for eligible individuals.
